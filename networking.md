üß† Ultimate Systems Cheat Sheet
(Computer Architecture + Application Architecture + Networking Basics)
________________________________________
üñ•Ô∏è 1. Computer Architecture
Concept	Key Idea
Disk	Persistent storage (HDD = slow, SSD = fast). 1 TB = 10¬π¬≤ bytes.
RAM	Volatile, fast memory (1GB‚Äì128GB). Erased when power is off.
CPU	Brain of the computer. Executes code, controls RAM & Disk.
Cache	Fastest memory (L1, L2, L3) inside CPU. Uses SRAM.
Virtual Memory	Disk used as extra RAM when full.
I/O Devices	Keyboard, mouse, monitor, etc. Slower than CPU/RAM.
Clock Speed	CPU speed, measured in GHz.
Multicore	More cores = more multitasking.
Moore‚Äôs Law	Transistors double every 2 years (but slowing down).

üåê 2. Application Architecture
Concept	Key Idea

Monolith	All-in-one app. Simple to start, hard to scale.
Microservices	Independent services. Scalable, flexible.
Client-Server	Client = requests. Server = responds.
Frontend	What users see (HTML, CSS, JS, React).
Backend	Logic & data (Node.js, Java, Python).
APIs	Let apps talk. REST = HTTP (GET, POST, etc).
Database	Stores data. SQL = structured. NoSQL = flexible.
Hosting	Local = dev, Production = users. Cloud = AWS/GCP/etc.
Load Balancer	Splits traffic across servers.
Stateless	No memory between requests.
Stateful	Remembers past interactions.
MVC Pattern	Model = data, View = UI, Controller = logic.
Auth	Authentication = who? Authorization = can do what?
DevOps	CI/CD tools (GitHub Actions, Docker, Jenkins).
Logging/Monitoring	Logs = record. Monitoring = real-time insights.

üì° 3. Networking Basics
Concept	Key Idea
IP Address	Unique ID for each device on a network.
IPv4 vs IPv6	IPv4 = older (e.g., 192.168.0.1). IPv6 = newer, longer.
MAC Address	Hardware ID (fixed).
DNS	Converts domain names to IP addresses.
Ports	Identify specific processes (e.g., 80 = HTTP).
HTTP/HTTPS	Protocols for web. HTTPS = secure (encrypted).
TCP vs UDP	TCP = reliable, slower. UDP = fast, no guarantee.
Firewall	Blocks/filters incoming/outgoing traffic.
Router	Connects different networks (e.g., home to internet).
Switch	Connects devices in the same network (LAN).
Latency	Delay in communication. Lower = better.
Bandwidth	Max data transfer rate (higher = faster).

‚úÖ Pro Tip: Think of these as layers ‚Äî
‚Ä¢	Networking = how devices talk.
‚Ä¢	Architecture = how systems are built.
‚Ä¢	Computer hardware = where it all runs.
