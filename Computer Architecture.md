📚 Computer Architecture - Ultimate Study Notes
________________________________________
🖥️ 1. Disk (Storage)
•	Persistent Storage: Data is saved even when the computer is off.
•	Sizes: Measured in GB (Gigabytes) or TB (Terabytes).
•	1 TB = 10¹² bytes (1 trillion bytes)
•	Types of Disks:
o	HDD (Hard Disk Drive): Slower, mechanical, wears out over time.
o	SSD (Solid State Drive): Faster, no moving parts, more expensive.

⚡️ 2. RAM (Memory)
•	Volatile Memory: Data is erased when the computer is turned off.
•	Faster than disk but smaller (1 GB to 128 GB).
•	Speed:
o	Writing 1 MB to RAM = microseconds (10⁻⁶ sec).
o	Writing 1 MB to disk = milliseconds (10⁻³ sec).
•	Stores: Running applications and program variables.
•	CPU needs to communicate with the disk.
•	Types of RAMS:
o	DRAM (Dynamic RAM): Slower, cheaper (used in the main RAM).
o	SRAM (Static RAM): Faster, more expensive (used in cache).

🧠 3. CPU (Processor)
•	Brain of the Computer: Reads/writes between RAM and disk.
•	Performs: All calculations (add, subtract, multiply, etc.).
•	Process:
1.	Fetches instructions from RAM.
2.	Decode them.
3.	Execute instructions.
•	CPU Clock Speed:
o	Measured in GHz (Gigahertz).
o	Determines how many instructions the CPU can process per second.
•	CPU Cores and Multithreading:
o	Single core vs. Multi-core: More cores → Faster multitasking.
o	Multithreading: Allows multiple tasks to run simultaneously.

⚡️ 4. Cache (Super-Fast Memory)
•	Located in CPU: Faster than RAM and disk.
•	Levels:
o	L1: Fastest, smallest.
o	L2: Larger, slower.
o	L3: Largest, slowest (but still faster than RAM).
•	Stores frequently accessed data.
•	Cache uses SRAM: Faster and more expensive than DRAM.
•	Caching Concept: Used in browsers to load web pages faster.

📂 5. Virtual Memory
•	Extension of RAM: When running out, part of the disk is used as extra RAM.
•	Slower than RAM but prevents crashes due to insufficient memory.
________________________________________
🖱️ 6. I/O Devices (Input/Output)
•	Examples: Keyboard, mouse, monitor, printer.
•	I/O operations are slower than memory or CPU operations.
________________________________________
📈 7. Moore’s Law
•	Observation: The number of transistors in a CPU doubles every 2 years.
•	Result: Faster computers, lower costs.
•	Trend: Slowing down in recent years.
