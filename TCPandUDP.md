ðŸ“¦ TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
Connection-oriented: Establishes a connection before sending data (like a phone call).

Reliable: Guarantees all data arrives in the correct order.

Error checking: Yes â€” includes retransmission if data is lost.

Ordered: Data is reassembled in the correct order.

Slower: Extra overhead due to reliability features.

Examples: Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS), email (SMTP), file transfer (FTP).

ðŸ“¦ UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
Connectionless: Sends data without a setup (like texting without a reply).

Unreliable: No guarantee data is received or arrives in order.

No error correction: Dropped packets are not resent.

Faster: Less overhead, useful for speed-critical apps.

Examples: Streaming (Netflix, YouTube), online gaming, VoIP (Zoom, Skype).
